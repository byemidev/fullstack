    participant server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/SPA 
    activate server
    server-->>browser: 304 status  CSS file is Not Modified  
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: the browser, using devtools, didnt give me another resource from the server : in source page i see spa, spa.css , spa.js .. probably only give it to me because the resto of the files are in memory or this SPA is rendered on the server side.
